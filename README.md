## Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Hello, my name is Zhengyu (Brian) Li and I am currently a student at University of Toronto Mississauga. I am pursing a Bachelor of Science degree with Mathematics specialist, economics and statistics minor.

I am passionate in finding real-life applications for theoretical mathematical ideas. Most abstract mathematical ideas do not have applicability, which is why I have a passion in discovering what can be accomplished. Mathematics is a powerful tool for me. I find it very exciting being able to apply mathematics and impact our society. In short, I do not believe in the clear boundry between pure Math and applied Math.

I am sufficient in Python, Java, JavaScript, R, MATLAB and have sufficient experiences in both academics and project implementation.

I am also involved with some student clubs and societies, specifically the [Mathematical and Computational Sciences Society (MCSS)](https://utmmcss.com/) and [UTM Society for Algorithmic Modelling (UTMSAM)](http://utmsam.sa.utoronto.ca/). I co-founded UTMSAM back in 2019 and this club means a lot to me.
