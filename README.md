## Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Brian Zhengyu Li and I am currently a 4th-year/senior student at University of Toronto Mississauga. I am pursing a Bachelor of Science degree with a Mathematics specialist.

My main research interest lies in combinatorics, graph theory, and automated reasoning while maintaining an open mind to explore various other branches of mathematics and computer science. I am motivated to use techniques in symbolic computation and machine learning to shed light on mathematical problems where possible.

I am also involved with some student clubs and societies, specifically the [Mathematical and Computational Sciences Society (MCSS)](https://utmmcss.com/) and [UTM Society for Algorithmic Modelling (UTMSAM)](http://utmsam.sa.utoronto.ca/).
